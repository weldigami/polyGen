This feature takes a csv file representing vertices on planar faces and fills the surfaces accordingly. You can generate your own csv files or use the ones in this repository. These files were generated from the data provided by David McCooey on http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/index.html. There are over 900 unique polyhedra to choose from so it is most convenient to browse the website for visuals before searching through the folders. Please check the website for more information on copyrights. 

I have also provided a python script to convert stl files into the required csv format. You can use the merge checkbox if you want to create a solid body and join coplanar faces. Enjoy!
